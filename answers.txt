2009 Iranian election MSE: 0.0007395833333333335
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 359
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE: 9641
2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.0359

Answer to Problem 7:

Although, it's 3.6% of genuine elections would be as different from the uniform distribution as the Iranian election was.
but it's within the range of 5% threshhold, so it may be fraudulent, but that wouldn't be high possibility.

Answer to Problem 8:

2008 United States election MSE: 0.0002566300868770006
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the 2008 United States election MSE: 550
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the 2008 United States election MSE: 9450
2008 United States election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.055

it's larger than 5%, so it may be fraudulent, and with an amount of possibilities.
